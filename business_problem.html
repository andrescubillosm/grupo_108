                                    retail sector,
                                    so much so that it is considered a measure of retail performance. Retail is a highly
                                    competitive industry
                                    and it is imperative to ensure that products are on the shelf when the customer is
                                    buying them.
                                    Consumers still prefer to shop at retail stores, but low shelf availability and a
                                    high number of
                                    out-of-stock events can affect their experience. Customers go to the retail outlet
                                    to find the products
                                    they want; if they cannot find what they are looking for on the shelves, they will
                                    choose a substitute product,
                                    leave empty-handed, or turn to a competitor to satisfy their needs. In each case,
                                    the retailer,
                                    the manufacturer and the customer all lose out.</p>

                                    according to which
                                    during March there has been an
                                    increase of 45% in the out-of-stock indicator compared to the same month of 2019.
                                    According to the logistics solutions company, the main causes of this situation are
                                    inventory inaccuracy (58%)
                                    and insufficient orders (56%).</p>
                                <p align="justify">The study, which the company has been conducting for 15 years,
                                    collects data through
                                    weekly visits to 207 points of sale, of the five main chains in the country, and
                                    located in 13 cities.</p>
                                <p align="justify">The products that have sold out the most on the shelves are items

                                    first aid (with an out-of-stock indicator of 43.6%), personal hygiene (26.3%) and
                                    liquid soap (23.7%).</p>
                                <p align="justify">In addition, for Saturday, March 14 and Sunday, March 15, there were
                                    increases of 10%
                                    and 21%, respectively, in units sold compared to the previous weekend.</p>

                                        <h2>The importance of the out-of-stock study</h2>


                                        <p align="justify">It should come as no surprise to anyone that out-of-stocks (OOS) are a critical problem for every retailer.
                                            But what continues to surprise is the lack of progress some retailers have made in controlling a problem that,
                                            while it may never be completely eliminated, can be successfully mitigated.<br><br>

                                        Stock-outs are the result of many factors from customer satisfaction to poor communication between vendors and retailers.
                                            But regardless of their cause, the fact remains that in-stock performance is both top of mind for most retailers
                                            and agnostic to trade channel or class.<br><br>

                                        For brick-and-mortar retailers, in-stock performance — most commonly calculated as share of assortment that
                                            has at-least one unit in store — is a critical litmus test for supply chains dependent on year-round assortments.<br><br>

                                        It’s logical to link assortment out-of-stocks to potential lost sales and subsequently margin loss.
                                            But the problem carries longer costs, too. Customer dissatisfaction, shopper defection and lost retail brand
                                            reputation are but a few.<br><br>

                                        Frequently, retailers overcorrect by holding higher inventory or spending hard fought gross margin dollars on expediting
                                            movement of goods. But preventing out-of-stocks today is possible, once the causes and
                                            effects are properly identified.<br><br>

                                        A.T. Kearney sees out-of-stocks impacting four key areas: loss of sales, customer loyalty, online order fulfillment
                                            from the store and shipping costs that eventually lead to margin erosion.<br><br>

                                        The impact of OOS is nuanced. It affects planned purchases differently than impulse buys; core basket items
                                            separately from brand items; and digital retailers differently from online merchants.
                                            But the event’s consequences remain negative and avoidable.<br><br>

                                            alt="" /></span>


                                        <p align="justify">


                                            So, what should retailers do?

                                        <h3> Start with accurate measurements </h3>

                                            Measurement and out-of-stock reduction go hand-in-hand.<br><br>

                                            Out of stock is measured against store inventory, and the accuracy of that inventory is a leading contributor to OOS.
                                            What makes reducing OOS particularly challenging is that visible out of stock performance — easily captured by a store
                                            walk through — often tells a different story than system measurements do.<br><br>

                                            Getting an accurate OOS measurement is a starting point for the solution, and better in-stock position
                                            starts with in-store inventory management and replenishment.
