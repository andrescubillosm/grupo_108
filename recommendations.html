        The future of OOS reduction is still far off, but perhaps a final solution to 
        but perhaps a final solution of functionally zero OOS levels is unlikely due to variables throughout the supply chain..<br>
        <br>
        Technological solutions have arrived to help reduce OOS. On the point-of-sale side, the overall OOS estimation should be more accurate, but there are some neglected practices, such as in the inventory system,
        we know what is supposed to be in the store, but often we don't know where it is in the store, likewise sampling should be targeted to the top selling products or those that represent the highest revenue and profitability, 
        it is clear that we are in a generation to have a complete solution that allows us to identify products and run the types of reports for pattern identification, sales and inventory analysis. That a retail store 
        has many tools to analyze their sales and inventory is a big step, but additionally the effort should be reflected in the manual supply of the shelves by the operators of each store, so it is important to have simple solutions 
        that allow improvements in the supply in the stores as shown in the following graph.

       Finally, it is important to highlight that for any statistical and data science analysis it is necessary to have a very good quality of data and a sufficiently robust history to apply the models proposed here, with a sufficiently 
       large and good quality data can significantly alleviate the pain of the OOS, but it does not really have "the final cure".
        <br><br>
        Therefore, there is more work to be done, to keep looking for ways to reduce OOS and to satisfy to reduce OOS and satisfy buyers. But we believe that if the recommendations we offer in this analysis We believe that if the 
        recommendations we offer in this analysis are implemented, a permanent reduction in OOS is possible and measurable, as are the resulting sales improvements, cost reduction and positive impact on shopper loyalty to stores 
        are very real. to the stores are very real. By following our method you can determine the amount of reduction you want to pursue.
        <br><br>
        For years, retailers have had unhappy shoppers due to product shortages, but some are but some are now setting their sights on the reduction issues OOSminorist determined. But now some retailers are stopping. A thorough OOS 
        analysis is the only way to determine what plans and resources to devote to OOS improvement. to devote to improving this aspect, not just to avoid losing customers and sales, but in the long term as part of an aggressive loyalty program.
